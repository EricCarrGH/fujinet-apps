TODO for APOD #FujiNet client

 * In ColorView 9 mode, maybe add PGMs on the sides for solid black
   borders

 * ColorView 15 mode

 * Occasionally, the menu doesn't reappear after viewing an image!
   (Keyboard controls still work)

 * Be more clever with storage space for bitmaps and display lists,
   to make more space available for features.
   + 8K allocated per bitmap, wasting 0.5K x 3
   + 1K allocated per display list, wasting (just under 0.5K) x 3
   (The trick is addressing 4K and 1K boundaries that affect
   bitmaps and display lists, respectively.)
