TODO for APOD #FujiNet client
2021-04-24

 * Break more parts of the code out into modules:
   * Display list setup

 * In ColorView 9 mode, maybe add PGMs on the sides for solid black
   borders (don't use DMA, obviously).

 * ColorView 15 mode.  [Server already supports!]

 * Graphics 15 (160x192) grey combined with Graphics 11 (80x192 hues)
   hybrid APAC mode.  ("Champions Interlace" style mode.)
   [Server needs to support]
