TODO for APOD #FujiNet client
2021-04-14

 * Be more clever with storage space for bitmaps and display lists,
   to make more space available for features.
   + 8K allocated per bitmap, wasting 0.5K x 3
   + 1K allocated per display list, wasting (just under 0.5K) x 3
   (The trick is addressing 4K and 1K boundaries that affect
   bitmaps and display lists, respectively.)

 * In ColorView 9 mode, maybe add PGMs on the sides for solid black
   borders (don't use DMA, obviously).

 * Apply Graphics 15 color palette (WIP project on server to
   pick 4 "best" colors, rather than simply rendering in greyscale).

 * ColorView 15 mode.

 * Graphics 15 (160x192) grey combined with Graphics 11 (80x192 hues)
   hybrid APAC mode.

 * Allow Shift and Ctrl < and > to change month and year
   (to more quickly pick dates).
