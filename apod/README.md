=======================================================

## Purpose
Fetch and view [NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/),
via the "apod" server (which converts it to a format suitable for quickly loading on
an Atari, via HTTP for an Atari with a #FujiNet and its `N:` device.)

## Work in progress
(Thom suggests just doing SIO directly, rather than using N: device.)
