# boot-disk-cc65-template

Here is an example CC65 linker file, associated source files, and an example program that when compiled, creates a complete boot loadable program contained in an ATR image, ready to boot in any Atari 8-bit system.

A description of each file is in src/.

The Makefile is the standard large project CC65 Makefile, which has been changed to by default output a file with the extension .atr.
