 * Can pull data from "Where the ISS?" to track upcoming
   positions on the map.
 * Previous ISS positions leave a trail (of sprites)
 * Improved default map colors; removed grid from continents
 * Faster and nicer looking text blitting over the map
 * Auto-refresh ISS's position (now press [R] to refresh manually)
 * Nicer color-cycling of ISS sprite
 * New STARTADDRESS (so folks who forget to disable BASIC can still
   run it)

2021-05-18 "OVERCAST"
 * Initial release
   + Displays map, fetches ISS position and can show who's in space
     (both via data from "Open-Notify")
