## Purpose
View the current position of the International Space Station
over the earth, and see how many people are in space, and who
they are.

This simple client utilizes the data available freely from
[Open Notify](http://open-notify.org/), "an open source project to provide
a simple programming interface for some of NASA's awesome data".

Work in progress!
