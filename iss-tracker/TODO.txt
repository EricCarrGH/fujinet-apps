TODO for ISS Tracker for #FujiNet
2021-05-20

 * Allow adjusting colors.
   * Save colors to FujiNet (app key); reload on start-up.

 * DLI for separate colors for the text window.

 * Consider changing background/border to black, and
   making blue ocean a foreground color

 * Ensure astronaut names word-wrap if needed (> 20 chars).
   * May need to deal with Unicode characters :-/

Other ideas:

 * Show night/day

 * Show tracker lines (where ISS was, and will be soon)
