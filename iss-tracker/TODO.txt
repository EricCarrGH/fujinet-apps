TODO for ISS Tracker for #FujiNet
2021-05-19

 * Show previous ISS positions on the map (additional PMGs).

 * Allow adjusting colors.

 * Save colors to FujiNet (app key); reload on start-up.

 * Ensure astronaut names word-wrap if needed (> 20 chars).

 * May need to deal with Unicode characters :-/

Other ideas:

 * Show night/day

 * Show tracker lines (where ISS was, and will be soon)
