Cookie Demo for #FujiNet
========================

WIP

Small C program that connects to a webserver, interacts in a way that
causes an HTTP web cookie to be set, stores the cookie, and then connects
again, sending the cookie back.  Uses #FujiNet AppKey storage to record
the cookie (useful for situations where an app is run directly as an XEX
rather than on a disk / disk image (ATR)).
