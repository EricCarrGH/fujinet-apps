# `libchessmove` - Valid chess move library for cc65

## Objective

A library which, given a chess board (the current state),
and a move (from and to positions for a piece on the board),
return whether or not the move is valid.  It is meant to be
useful for implementing two-player chess games, e.g. played
online via FujiNet.
