# 5 Card Stud Client

This is an implimentation of a client for "5 Card Stud", written in FastBasic by Eric Carr. It demonstrates using FujiNet to read/write **AppKeys** and parse **JSON** to communicate with the 5 Card Server, and should run on any Atari 8-bit with 48K memory or higher.

## Details

All game logic takes place at the server. This client simply requests and presents the state on the screen, accepting user input for moves when needed.

## Help Needed
Interested in developing your own client on another platform that supports FujiNet? Read more about the details of client implementation at the 5 Card Mock Server readme available at https://github.com/FujiNetWIFI/servers/tree/main/5cardstud/server/mock-server.
